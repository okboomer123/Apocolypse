<h1 style="font-size:300%;">Month 2</h1>
<p> In the second month my college is now teaching through video calls because of social distancing and this effects my budget a little bit for the better. Other than that my budget is not changed very much.
<br>
<p> Month two is not very different my utilities and rent is $400, My phone bill is $80, Food is around $80 and I pay around $10 to $20 for gas. Since schools are closing down my college now teaches with online classes therefore I do not have to use my car as much which uses less gas. During this month I spend $560
