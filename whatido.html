<p> Olviouly with this type of senario you would want be able to buy the most possible food for the least ammount of money. Lets jsut say you were supposed to live for a month with this money. I wouldn't buy food that would go bad like bread or milk. I would probably shop at costco too
  since they sell in bulk. I would buy multiple cases of water and I would buy mac and cheese and other processed foods like chips. I would also most likely only eat breakfist and dinner and skip lunch to conserve food.
