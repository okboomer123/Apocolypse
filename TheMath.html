<h1 style="font-size:300%;">The Math</h1>
<p> Immediaty after I would get the money I would split it. Half of it for paying bills and the other for food and whatever is left over after the food buying would become emergency money if I needed to buy something or my math was off I still had money left over instead of just blowing it all away.

  <br>
  <p> Assuming you just came out of college, you have a home, and you own a car with a loan on all three you also need to take these things into perspective because you cant just not pay for these. So the best Idea would be to start saving money now for emergencies like not being able to work.
